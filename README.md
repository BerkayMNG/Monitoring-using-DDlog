# Monitoring-using-DDlog

In this repository, we employ DDlog to develop a prototype monitoring tool
based on metric first-order temporal logic (MFOTL). The purpose is to analyze the advantages of integrating differential 
computation into the monitoring process. Additionally, we provide a collection of benchmarks that include
measurements and input generators, showing our investigations.
